### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Overview: Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Findings
  Through the analysis of the Kickstarter data 'Theater' parent companies have the highest overall successfull fundraising outcomes. On a closer analysis of subcategory statistics plays have the highest success rate for fundraising overall as well as in the US and Great Britain. Moreover the data shows that the month that recieved the best outcomes based on launch date was May and although there are high success outcomes in January, June, July and October the failed outcomes had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched durring that time. 
  Through an analysis of descriptive statistics we are able to glean that failed Kickstarter campaigns have higher funraising goals with a mean goal of $10,554, as opposed to the average successful Kickstarter campaign that has a mean goal of $5,049. Because the estimated Kickstarter fundraising goal for 'Fever' is nearly twice the amount of the mean goal of successful Kickstarter campaigns this does not bode well for meeting the estimated $10,000 fundraising goal. 
  For the future project of creating a play in Great Britian the data shows that the mean campaign goal for musicals is approximately $4,000.

## Recommendations

In a complete analysis of Kickstarter Data supplied the recommendation to the client is that she try to get her play produced in the US for less that her estamted budget of $10,000. A more conservative kickstarter goal would be approximately $5,000 launching in the month of May. Furthermore, when looking to a potential future project in Great Britian, the client should try to get her play produced for less than £4,000 as the mean campaign goal is around £4,000 with half of the campaign goals being less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
